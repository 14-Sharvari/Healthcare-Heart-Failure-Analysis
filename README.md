# Healthcare-Heart-Failure-Analysis

## Problem Statement:
Healthcare providers face significant challenges in analyzing clinical data to improve outcomes for heart failure patients. With critical metrics—such as patient demographics, clinical indicators, and treatment outcomes—often scattered, it becomes difficult to derive insights necessary for enhancing patient care and optimizing treatment strategies. This project aims to address these challenges by creating an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes heart failure clinical records, enabling healthcare professionals to monitor trends, assess risk factors, and make data-driven decisions to improve patient outcomes and resource allocation in heart failure management.

## Overview:
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard based on heart failure clinical records to provide healthcare professionals with insights into patient demographics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes. The dashboard is designed to streamline the interpretation of heart failure data, highlighting critical metrics such as age, gender, serum sodium, and ejection fraction. By consolidating this information into a user-friendly format, the dashboard enables healthcare providers to analyze patterns, identify at-risk patients, and make data-driven decisions that support improved care and management of heart failure patients.

## Objectives:
•	Data Consolidation: Aggregate heart failure clinical data into a centralized, visual platform for easier access and understanding.

•	Risk Factor Analysis: Enable the identification of key risk factors such as age, blood pressure, and serum sodium levels that correlate with patient outcomes.

•	Outcome Monitoring: Visualize and track clinical outcomes across different patient demographics to assess treatment effectiveness and improve care strategies.

•	Support Data-Driven Decision Making: Empower healthcare professionals with insights to make informed decisions, optimize treatment plans, and allocate resources effectively for heart failure management.

•	Facilitate Preventive Care: Provide insights to proactively identify at-risk patients, potentially reducing readmission rates and improving overall patient outcomes.
